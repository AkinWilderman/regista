## Overview

regista is a package for performing some of the common modelling tasks in soccer
analytics.

## Installation

regista is not currently available on CRAN but can be downloaded from github like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("torvaney/regista")
```

## Examples

### Dixon-Coles

The ["Dixon-Coles model"](http://web.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf) is a modified poisson model, specifically designed for estimating teams' strengths and for predicting football matches. 

Regista provides an implementation of this model:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(regista)

fit <- dixoncoles(hgoal, agoal, home, away, data = premier_league_2010)

print(fit)
```

The Dixon-Coles model provides estimates of each team's offensive and defensive strength, along with
an estimate of home-field advantage (`hfa`):

```{r}
parameters <- tibble::tibble(
  parameter = names(fit$par),
  value     = fit$par
)

parameters
```

Regista also comes with a `predict` method, to predict the goalscoring 
rate of either team, or the probabilities of different possible scorelines or 
match outcomes:

```{r}
# Create a copy of the original data and attach predictions
to_predict <- premier_league_2010
to_predict$predictions <- predict(fit, newdata = premier_league_2010)

to_predict
```

The regista package is designed to work fluidly with the tidyverse and tidy principles.
For instance, predictions can be handled easily with the [broom package](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/07/broom-0-5-0/).

To get predictions of Home/Draw/Away probabilities as columns in a
dataframe, you can use the `broom::augment` function:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

fit %>% 
  augment(newdata = premier_league_2010, type = "outcomes") %>% 
  unnest() %>%
  mutate(prob = scales::percent(prob, 2)) %>%  # Prettify output
  spread(outcome, prob) %>% 
  select(home, away, home_win, draw, away_win, result)
```

Or to get model parameters in a table format:

```{r}
tidy(fit)
```

(Note that team parameter estimates are in log space).

A more flexible api is provided with `dixoncoles_ext`, which allows the base Dixon-Coles model to be extended arbitrarily.

* The [goalmodel](https://github.com/opisthokonta/goalmodel) R package contains an
implementation of the Dixon-Coles model, along with some additional method for
modelling the number of goals scored in sports games.
