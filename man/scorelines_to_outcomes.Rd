\title{Aggregate scoreline probabilities to 1X2 probabilities}
\usage{
scorelines_to_outcomes(scorelines, hgoal = hgoal, agoal = agoal,
  prob = prob)
}
\arguments{
\item{scorelines}{A dataframe containing the scoreline probabilities}

\item{hgoal}{The column containing home goals}

\item{agoal}{The column containing away goals}

\item{prob}{The column containing the probability of that given scoreline}
}
\description{
Often we are more interested in the outcome of a match (home win, draw,
away win) than we are in the scorelines. This is a helper function that
aggregates scoreline probabilities to outcome probabilities.
